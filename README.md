``` This is not a portfolio, it is just a normal website where I try to collect all my projects that are under my 100 react projects goal.```

Hi, This project itself is very special to me. The idea of this project was in the back of my mind for a very long time. And I made the structure of the website months ago. but I modified it from time to time and will make updates to the project in the future. It will contain all my react projects. My goal is to make 100 react applications. I know I am not even close to my goal But I am working my way slowly and steadily.

The goal has given me a lot of experience. I worked on a lot of different projects and if you look closely you can see my journey from making static websites to complete websites. I will polish my work and make it more efficient through this goal.

# Now Let's talk about the website features:
1. It is responsive.
2. It has a dedicated projects page. I think that is the main attraction.
3. The website is dynamic. This means I do not need to write a single code to add projects, update them, or delete them.
4. It has a secret route just for me to visit and I can add, update, and delete projects.
5. On one of those secret routes it will show me the project count and how many projects are left. I did this to keep track of the status of my goals easily. 
6. On the project page I added a fully functional search function.
7. Also I added a functional pagination section.
8. Visitors can Directly visit the live website of can see the GitHub Repo.
